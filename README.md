# jinstr

Python/Javascript/HTML-based instrumentation/automation environment for local/remote system control and monitoring

## Directories: ##

* **src:** Contains the following directories:
    * **js:** Javascript source files (keep them separate for now)
    * **css:** CSS source files (keep them separate for now)
    * **python:** Python source files (keep them separate for now)
* **examples:** Example html and Python pages for individual module demos (currently front-end focused, will add back-end examples eventually)


## Front-End Modules ##

Below are the front-end modules and their descriptions.

### `Time_Series` (needs updating) ###

```
Time_Series(div_id,width,height,x_range,y_range,num_traces,colors, unique, socket=null){
```

There are a number of inputs to this function, all of which must be specified (no defaults):

* `div_id`: The html DOM id of where you want to build the plot (valid string)
* `width`:  Width of plotter in pixels (integer)
* `height`: Height of plotter in pixels (integer)
* `x_range`: Number of data points to be displayed in intial rendering (integer)
* `y_range`: Initial y-axis range (two-long array: `[min_y, max_y]`)
* `num_traces`: Number of traces to plot (integer)
* `colors`: Colors for plots (array of strings...either hex values (e.g. `#00FF00` for bright green, for example or `green` and other standard D3-colors
* `unique`: A unique (for the page) identifier for the jinstrument object that is to be generated (can be numbers or letters, but ideally no special characters)
* `socket`: a socket for connection, updating

There are three methods associated with the chart:

* `setup()`: Primarily an internal method that should not need to be called by a user
* `update()`: Rebuilds the plot if ranges or other aspects of it have changed (while saving data rendered so far). Also generally not meant to be used by user
* `step(values)`: Takes an array `values` that contains the next/newest set of data for the different traces to be plotted. Values must be in proper order, and the quantity of entries in the array must match the expected values for the plot.

An example set of supporting code would be:

```
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="./js/time_series.js" ></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/gui.css">
```

with a body of:
```
<body>
  <div id="plotbox"></div>
</body>
```

And then the following script in the document:

```
var plot = new Time_Series("plotbox",300, 200,60,[0,1000],2,["red","blue"]);
```

Followed by some sort of call to `step` with appropriate data such as:

```
plot.step([2,3]);
```

### `Time_Parallel`

Similar to Time series but there are two flavors: Line and Bar.  

### `Numerical_Display`

Bring in:


and with a body of :

```
<body>
  <div id="pos_1"></div>
</body>
```

and then the following script in teh document:

```
var reporter_x = new Numerical_Reporter("pos_1","X Position",[-100,500],"red","black");
var reporter_y = new Numerical_Reporter("pos_1","Y Position",[50,250],"yellow","blue");
```

You can then simply update numbers in it like so:

```
reporter_x.step(Math.random());
reporter_y.step(Math.random());  
```

#### Arguments:

```
function Numerical_Reporter(div_id,title,range,color,bg_color, unique, socket=null){
```

10/15/2017 Update: No longer uses jquery (pure vanilla JS)

* `div_id`: The DOM div where you want the thing to live
* `title`: The title you'd like to show up for your plot
* `range`: If you'd like to limit the displayed numerical range use this. It needs an array of `[low_limit,high_limit]`.  If you'd like to avoid using this, specify a `range` of `[,]`
* `color`: Color of the displayed font
* `bg_color`: Background color of the displayed font.
* `unique`: Unique identifier (used for id-ing divs, etc...)...up to user to make sure this is unique
* `socket`: a Websocket object (a la `socket.io.js`)


### `Toggle`

10/15/2017 Update: No longer uses jquery (pure vanilla JS)

```
function Toggle(div_id,title,names,unique,socket=null)
```

* `div_id`: The DOM where you want the thing to live
* `title`: The title of the toggle you'd like to see
* `names`: A two-long array specifying the "0" and "1" terms for the switch, respectively
* `unique`: The unique (for the page) identifying alphanumeric term used by the element
* `socket`: A Websocket object (`socket.io.js`)




### `Slider`

```
function Slider(div_id,name,min,max,resolution,unique,socket){
```

To manually build a slider, you need to specify everything except a socket, which is optional:

* `div_id` : The html DOM id of where you want to build the plot (valid string)
* `name`: The name for the slider, can be the same as div_id
* `min` : The minimum value of the slider
* `max` : The maximum value of the slider
* `resolution` : The resolution that the slider value will change as it is automated or controlled
* `unique`: A unique (for the page) identifier for the jinstrument object that is to be generated (can be numbers or letters, but ideally no special characters)
* `socket`: a socket for connection, updating. Defaults to null.

An example set of supporting code would be:

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="./js/slider.js" ></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/gui.css">
```

with a body of:
```
<body>
  <div id="magic"></div>
</body>
```

And then the following script in the document:
(Note that socket is not specified, which is fine)

```
var slider = new Slider("magic","Magic Johnson",0,100,1,123456);
```
You will probably notice `slider_generate()` and `build_sliders()` in the code. These are functions that are only called if you have a page building off of a specified config.json. 

### `Joystick`

Things it needs:
    
    * X-Y Sensitivity (must have some sort of event it triggers)...need to think about how to generalize triggering of async events in general
    * Center-Return/Not-Center-Return Option

## Module State

Currently I'm working on allowing the saving of system state so that you can easily reload a page and all the slider settings as needed.  AS a result, all front-end modules in the page will be able to return their system state such as zoom levels, current slider values, etc...
